# TODO List with EXPRESS + PUG + ALPINEJS

This is a small project just to see how I learn about this tecnologies

In order to run this project just follow the next steps:

1. Run the commnad
    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```
2. Open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**, and make sure your port ```3000``` is not in use.

3. And that's it, nothing more to do.

## About the TODO App üòÅ

Is a simple **TODO App** so I didn't implement anything about authentication or validation, this **app** is just for fun and to see, how much I learned in a few days?

Feel free to let me know if you have any advice üëç

### Note

Just remember that all the data is not being persisted in any DB, is just a simple **array** to simulate the DB, every time you shut down the server the data is lost.
